Code for a Flask webserver intended to give users a live video feed of a remote control car and allow them to drive it with their keyboard.

Camera code is based on the works of Eric Chio:

I redid the site to add flask-socketio to allow data to be transmitted back. Due to the demanding nature of Eric's code I'm not sure the two things will ever work simultaneously.
